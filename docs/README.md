# King Gaze Game - Documentation

## Overview
Comprehensive documentation for the King Gaze Game project - a React + Phaser.js tower defense-style resource management game.

## Documentation Structure

### üìö [Architecture Documentation](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
High-level system architecture, design patterns, and project structure.

**What you'll find:**
- Core architecture principles and design philosophy
- Complete project structure breakdown
- Key systems overview (Building, Gaze, Resource, State Management)
- Performance optimization strategies
- Development workflows and debugging guidelines

**Best for:** Understanding the overall system design and getting oriented with the codebase.

### üéÆ [Game Systems Documentation](./GAME_SYSTEMS.md)
Detailed technical documentation of all game mechanics and systems.

**What you'll find:**
- Building system architecture (AbstractBuilding, Registry, Factory patterns)
- Gaze system mechanics (Strategy pattern, two-stage rotation)
- Resource production and management flows
- Preview system and visual feedback
- State management patterns (Zustand stores)
- Input handling and game controls

**Best for:** Deep diving into specific game mechanics and understanding implementation details.

### üîß [API Reference & Development Guidelines](./API_REFERENCE.md)
Complete API documentation and practical development patterns.

**What you'll find:**
- Core APIs (GameConfig, Type definitions)
- Store APIs (GameStore, BuildingStore, EventStore)
- Building System APIs (AbstractBuilding, Registry, Factory)
- Gaze System APIs (Strategy, System, Utilities)
- Step-by-step development patterns
- Testing guidelines and performance best practices

**Best for:** Hands-on development work, adding new features, and following established patterns.

## Quick Start for Developers

### New to the Project?
1. Start with [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) - Get the big picture
2. Read [GAME_SYSTEMS.md](./GAME_SYSTEMS.md) - Understand the mechanics
3. Reference [API_REFERENCE.md](./API_REFERENCE.md) - Start coding

### Working on Specific Features?
- **Adding Buildings**: See API_REFERENCE.md ‚Üí "Adding New Building Types"
- **Modifying Gaze**: See GAME_SYSTEMS.md ‚Üí "Gaze System"
- **UI Changes**: See API_REFERENCE.md ‚Üí "Adding New UI Components"
- **Configuration**: See ARCHITECTURE.md ‚Üí "Configuration System"

### Need Quick Reference?
- **Constants**: `src/config/GameConfig.ts`
- **Types**: `src/types/index.ts`
- **Stores**: `src/stores/` (gameStore, buildingStore, eventStore)
- **Main Scene**: `src/game/KingGazeScene.ts`

## Project Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev       # Start development server
npm run build     # Build for production
npm run lint      # Check code quality
npm run preview   # Preview production build

# Testing (when implemented)
npm test          # Run unit tests
npm run test:e2e  # Run end-to-end tests
```

## Claude AI Assistant Setup

The project includes a comprehensive Claude configuration in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) that provides:
- Project overview and key features
- Core architecture principles and critical patterns
- Development workflows and debugging guidelines
- File locations for common tasks
- Code quality standards and performance requirements

This configuration enables the Claude AI assistant to effectively work with the codebase while maintaining architectural consistency.

## Key Design Principles

### Configuration-Driven Development
- All constants in `GameConfig.ts`
- Zero hardcoded values
- Easy balancing and tweaking

### Type Safety First
- Strict TypeScript with no `any` types
- Comprehensive interfaces
- Compile-time error catching

### Pattern-Based Architecture
- Factory Pattern for building creation
- Registry Pattern for definitions
- Strategy Pattern for gaze shapes
- Observer Pattern for state management

### Phaser-Optimized Performance
- Graphics API for complex rendering
- Object pooling for frequent operations
- Efficient update loops with delta time
- Proper memory management

## Contributing Guidelines

1. **Read Documentation First**: Understand existing patterns before implementing
2. **Follow Established Patterns**: Use Factory, Registry, and Strategy patterns consistently
3. **Configuration-Driven**: Add all constants to GameConfig.ts
4. **Type Safety**: Define interfaces before implementation
5. **Test Coverage**: Add tests for new features
6. **Documentation**: Update docs when adding new systems or architectural changes
