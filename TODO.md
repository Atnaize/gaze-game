Add footer with github link + copyright + website
Fix swordsmen sprites
Add achivements
Fix game stats in game over screen
    Waves Survived is not shown
    Soliders lost is not working correctly
    Gold earned is still 0
    Total battles can be removed

Add tooltip for building stats

Add persistant loot
    - Add menu to buy permanent upgrades with persistant loot


Ideas:
    Make the game unifinishable at the begining. You are forced to die but make it possible to unlock things
    You will still die but can still upgrade
    Game is easier and easier but ennemies will be stronger depending of upgrade you unlocked ?
