## Persistant loot
When a special event is reached X waves cleared or during achivements, a new persistant ressource is earned
This resource will be persistant and stored for all new game
This resource will unlock special feature or permanent upgrades

## Unit moving
When there is no ennemies, make the solider returning to the wall
When game is paused, make the sprite (enemies and solider) in the idle state, that could be funny
I don't want all unit the stacked une behind each other, we should see them visually, could be great that they can collide a little bit to have a more natural behavior

# Ideas

## Concept
Make the game unifinishable at the begining. You are forced to die but make it possible to unlock things
You will still die but can still upgrade
Game is easier and easier but ennemies will be stronger depending of upgrade you unlocked ?
